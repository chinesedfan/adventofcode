## Introduction

This project contains solutions for [Advent of Code](http://adventofcode.com/).

The difficulty of these puzzles is much less than Online Judge problems'. Even you can calculate the answer by an pencil and paper. Test cases are very simple and examples include nearly every thing that you need care about.

And the author provides a very interesting website!

ps.  
- I use lots of regular expressions to parse the input. Remeber to covert `string` to `int`.
