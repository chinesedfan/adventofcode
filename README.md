## Introduction

This project contains solutions for [Advent of Code](http://adventofcode.com/).

The difficulty of these puzzles is much less than Online Judge problems'. Even you can calculate the answer by an pencil and paper. Test cases are very simple and examples include nearly every thing that you need care about.

And the author provides a very interesting website!

ps.  
- How to run? `node index.js <day> [part]`, by default, `part` is `1`.  
- Remeber to call `parseInt` when parsing the input by regular expressions.
